# Create Docs from Invoices with Infofla

This guide shows how to convert vendor invoices (PDF/JPG/PNG) into structured data and human‑readable docs (Markdown/JSON/CSV) using Infofla. You’ll set up field extraction, validate results, and generate consistent documentation your team can publish or pipe into downstream systems.

Reference: [Infofla website](https://www.infofla.com/en/home)

---

## Prerequisites

- A set of representative sample invoices (at least 5–10, covering different vendors/layouts)
- An Infofla account and access to a workspace/project
- Decision on output format(s): Markdown for readable docs, JSON/CSV for data pipes

---

## 1) Define your target schema (fields you care about)

Start by deciding the exact fields you want in your final docs. Keep names stable and explicit.

```json
{
  "invoiceNumber": "INV-2024-0001",
  "invoiceDate": "2024-06-30",
  "supplier": {
    "name": "Acme Ltd",
    "address": "123 Market St, Springfield",
    "vatId": "GB123456789"
  },
  "buyer": {
    "name": "Your Company",
    "address": "42 Startup Ave, London"
  },
  "currency": "USD",
  "subtotal": 1999.5,
  "tax": 399.9,
  "total": 2399.4,
  "dueDate": "2024-07-30",
  "lineItems": [
    {
      "description": "Pro subscription (12 months)",
      "qty": 1,
      "unitPrice": 1999.5,
      "lineTotal": 1999.5
    }
  ],
  "notes": "Thanks for your business."
}
```

Tip: Capture optional fields you might need later (e.g., purchaseOrder, paymentTerms, bankIban).

---

## 2) Create an Infofla project and upload samples

1. Create a new project (e.g., “Invoice → Docs”).
2. Upload a diverse set of invoices: different vendors, formats, and qualities.
3. Group similar layouts if you expect multiple templates (e.g., Vendor A vs Vendor B).

Goal: Give the extractor enough variety to learn anchors and patterns.

---

## 3) Configure extraction: anchors, patterns, tables

Use a mix of anchors (labels like “Invoice #”, “Total”), regex patterns, and table detection for line items.

```yaml
fields:
  invoiceNumber:
    anchors: ["Invoice #", "Invoice No", "Invoice Number"]
    regex: "[A-Z]{2,}-?\d{3,}"
  invoiceDate:
    anchors: ["Invoice Date", "Date"]
    dateFormats: ["YYYY-MM-DD", "DD/MM/YYYY", "MMM D, YYYY"]
  supplier.name:
    anchors: ["From", "Supplier", "Vendor"]
  total:
    anchors: ["Total", "Amount Due"]
    currency: true

tables:
  lineItems:
    headerAnchors: ["Description", "Qty", "Unit Price", "Amount"]
    columns:
      - key: description
        match: ["Description", "Item", "Service"]
      - key: qty
        match: ["Qty", "Quantity"]
        number: true
      - key: unitPrice
        match: ["Unit Price", "Price"]
        currency: true
      - key: lineTotal
        match: ["Amount", "Line Total"]
        currency: true
```

Tips:
- Add multiple synonyms for robustness.
- Normalize currencies and dates.
- For variable layouts, prefer multiple weak anchors over a single strict one.

---

## 4) Test and validate on samples

Run extraction on your sample set and review field‑by‑field:

- Spot‑check high‑impact fields: invoiceNumber, total, tax, dueDate
- Confirm table parsing: row count, numeric totals, currency symbols
- Add post‑processing rules (e.g., trim whitespace, uppercase VAT IDs)

Iterate: adjust anchors/regex/date formats until accuracy is acceptable (≥99% on key totals).

---

## 5) Map data to a documentation template

If you want human‑readable docs, design a Markdown template. Keep it deterministic and concise.

```md
---
title: Invoice {{ invoiceNumber }}
description: Invoice from {{ supplier.name }} on {{ invoiceDate }} totaling {{ total }} {{ currency }}
tags:
  - invoice
  - {{ supplier.name }}
---

# Invoice {{ invoiceNumber }}

- Date: {{ invoiceDate }}
- Supplier: {{ supplier.name }}
- Buyer: {{ buyer.name }}
- Currency: {{ currency }}

## Totals

- Subtotal: {{ subtotal }}
- Tax: {{ tax }}
- Total: {{ total }}

## Line Items

| Description | Qty | Unit Price | Line Total |
| ----------- | ---:| ----------:| ----------:|
{{#each lineItems}}
| {{ description }} | {{ qty }} | {{ unitPrice }} | {{ lineTotal }} |
{{/each}}

{{#if notes}}
## Notes

{{ notes }}
{{/if}}
```

Notes:
- Use a templating syntax supported by your Infofla setup (e.g., Handlebars‑style shown above).
- Keep frontmatter minimal and machine‑readable.

---

## 6) Choose outputs and destinations

Common outputs:

- JSON: for pipeline ingestion (ETL, data warehouse)
- CSV: for quick analysis/spreadsheets
- Markdown: for readable docs in repos/wikis
- Webhook/API: trigger downstream automations

Decide destinations:
- Git repository (docs as code)
- Object storage (S3/GCS/Azure Blob)
- Knowledge base or wiki
- Finance tools (AP/ERP) via webhook

---

## 7) Run at scale and monitor quality

- Batch process new invoices on a schedule or webhook
- Track extraction accuracy on key fields (totals, dates, identifiers)
- Add alerts when confidence drops or validations fail (e.g., subtotal + tax ≠ total)

Example validation ideas:

```yaml
validations:
  totals_balance: "abs((subtotal + tax) - total) < 0.01"
  has_invoice_number: "invoiceNumber != ''"
  has_at_least_one_item: "len(lineItems) > 0"
```

---

## Example: From invoice to doc

Input (snippet):

```
Acme Ltd
Invoice # INV-2024-0001
Invoice Date: 2024-06-30
...
Description         Qty   Unit Price   Amount
Pro subscription     1      1999.50    1999.50
Subtotal: 1999.50  Tax: 399.90  Total: 2399.40
```

Extracted JSON (key fields):

```json
{
  "invoiceNumber": "INV-2024-0001",
  "invoiceDate": "2024-06-30",
  "supplier": { "name": "Acme Ltd" },
  "currency": "USD",
  "subtotal": 1999.5,
  "tax": 399.9,
  "total": 2399.4,
  "lineItems": [
    { "description": "Pro subscription", "qty": 1, "unitPrice": 1999.5, "lineTotal": 1999.5 }
  ]
}
```

Rendered Markdown (excerpt):

```md
# Invoice INV-2024-0001

- Date: 2024-06-30
- Supplier: Acme Ltd
- Currency: USD

## Totals

- Subtotal: 1999.5
- Tax: 399.9
- Total: 2399.4
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- Numbers parse incorrectly: tighten currency/number regex and set locale.
- Dates flip day/month: explicitly list accepted `dateFormats` and prefer ISO output.
- Line items misaligned: add/rename header synonyms; increase header detection confidence.
- Missing totals: add anchors for both “Total” and “Amount Due”; consider multi‑anchor matches.

---

## Next steps

- Expand schema with purchase order, payment terms, and IBAN.
- Add vendor‑specific templates for stubborn layouts.
- Automate publishing to your docs site or repo.
